# Web Performance Auditor

A simple web application for running Google Lighthouse audits on multiple URLs. This tool allows you to quickly assess
the performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices of your websites.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:ashuksu/auditor.git
cd auditor
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

```bash
# Start the application
# The server will run on http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

## Features

* Bulk Auditing: Enter multiple URLs to audit them in one go.
* Dual-Device Testing: Each URL is tested on both mobile and desktop emulations.
* Averaged Results: The application runs 3 passes for each URL/device combination and presents the average scores and
  standard deviation for more stable metrics.
* Detailed Reports: Provides links to the full, detailed HTML reports generated by Lighthouse for each pass.
* Simple Interface: A clean and straightforward UI to start audits and view results.

## Tech Stack

* Backend: Node.js with Express.js
* Frontend: HTML, CSS (SCSS), and vanilla JavaScript
* Auditing Engine: Google Lighthouse

## How It Works
The user submits a list of URLs through the web interface. The Express server receives the list and, for each URL,
launches a headless Chrome instance to run a Lighthouse audit. It performs this for both mobile and desktop
configurations, runs three passes for consistency, and calculates the average results. The aggregated data is then sent
back to the client to be displayed in a summary table, with links to the individual detailed reports.
